# Pattern Cleaner

This is a simple tool to assist with cleaning up messy HTML, especially what comes out of Word. Sure there are plenty of online tools, but I wanted something simple that still allowed regular expressions. And it's not limited to just HTML, since it's just performing string manipulations, but I've only used it with HTML (so far).

Everything is done in the browser, and the only thing stored anywhere is in your own browser (using localStorage). There are no analytics or sniffers, so I have no idea how this thing gets used. Maybe give this repo a star if you like it, just so I know if it's of use?

Cheers!

## TODO

* A better semblance of a UI?
